- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lidia JÄ™drzejewska
- ðŸ‘€ My passion is centered around building useful electronic devices that can be programmed later on. Working closely with hardware is something that makes me happy. I do a lot of SoC programming, mostly in C/C++.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently an engineering student at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology. My field of study is electronics and telecommunication, with a specialization in digital electronics. We learn a lot about low-level programming and hardware configuration.
